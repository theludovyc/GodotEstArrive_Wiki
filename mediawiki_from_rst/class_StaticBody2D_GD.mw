A StaticBody2D is a body that is not intended to move. It is ideal for implementing objects in the environment, such as walls or platforms.Additionally, a constant linear or angular velocity can be set for the static body, which will affect colliding bodies as if it were moving (for example, a conveyor belt).== Properties =={| class="wikitable | float|| [[#constant_angular_velocity|constant_angular_velocity]]|| {{Span|0.0}}             |-| [[Vector2 GD|Vector2]]|| [[#constant_linear_velocity|constant_linear_velocity]]|| {{Span|Vector2( 0, 0 )}} |-| [[PhysicsMaterial GD|PhysicsMaterial]]|| [[#physics_material_override|physics_material_override]]||                     |}== Property Descriptions ===== constant_angular_velocity ===*  float '''constant_angular_velocity'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|0.0}}                              |-| ''Setter''|| set_constant_angular_velocity(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_constant_angular_velocity()      |}The body's constant angular velocity.
