__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Reference GD|Reference]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]Contains the results of a [[RegEx GD|RegEx]] search.== Description ==Contains the results of a single [[RegEx GD|RegEx]] match returned by [[RegEx GD#search|RegEx.search()]] and [[RegEx GD#search_all|RegEx.search_all()]]. It can be used to find the position and range of the match and its capturing groups, and it can extract its substring for you.== Properties =={| class="wikitable | [[Dictionary GD|Dictionary]]|| [[#names|names]]|| {{Span|{}}}   |-| [[Array GD|Array]]|| [[#strings|strings]]|| {{Span|[  ]}} |-| [[String GD|String]]|| [[#subject|subject]]|| {{Span|""}}   |}== Methods =={| class="wikitable | int|| [[#get_end|get_end]] '''(''' [[Variant GD|Variant]] name=0 ''')''' const       |-| int|| [[#get_group_count|get_group_count]] '''(''' ''')''' const                            |-| int|| [[#get_start|get_start]] '''(''' [[Variant GD|Variant]] name=0 ''')''' const   |-| [[String GD|String]]|| [[#get_string|get_string]] '''(''' [[Variant GD|Variant]] name=0 ''')''' const |}== Property Descriptions ===== names ===*  [[Dictionary GD|Dictionary]] '''names'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|{}}}      |-| ''Getter''|| get_names() |}A dictionary of named groups and its corresponding group number. Only groups with that were matched are included. If multiple groups have the same name, that name would refer to the first matching one.=== strings ===*  [[Array GD|Array]] '''strings'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|[  ]}}      |-| ''Getter''|| get_strings() |}An [[Array GD|Array]] of the match and its capturing groups.=== subject ===*  [[String GD|String]] '''subject'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|""}}        |-| ''Getter''|| get_subject() |}The source string used with the search pattern to find this matching result.== Method Descriptions ===== get_end ===*  int '''get_end''' '''(''' [[Variant GD|Variant]] name=0 ''')''' constReturns the end position of the match within the source string. The end position of capturing groups can be retrieved by providing its group number as an integer or its string name (if it's a named group). The default value of 0 refers to the whole pattern.Returns -1 if the group did not match or doesn't exist.=== get_group_count ===*  int '''get_group_count ( )''' constReturns the number of capturing groups.=== get_start ===*  int '''get_start''' '''(''' [[Variant GD|Variant]] name=0 ''')''' constReturns the starting position of the match within the source string. The starting position of capturing groups can be retrieved by providing its group number as an integer or its string name (if it's a named group). The default value of 0 refers to the whole pattern.Returns -1 if the group did not match or doesn't exist.=== get_string ===*  [[String GD|String]] '''get_string''' '''(''' [[Variant GD|Variant]] name=0 ''')''' constReturns the substring of the match from the source string. Capturing groups can be retrieved by providing its group number as an integer or its string name (if it's a named group). The default value of 0 refers to the whole pattern.Returns an empty string if the group did not match or doesn't exist.
