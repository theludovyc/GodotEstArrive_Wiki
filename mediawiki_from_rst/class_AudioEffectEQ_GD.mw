Gives you control over frequencies.Use it to create a custom equalizer if [[AudioEffectEQ6 GD|AudioEffectEQ6]], [[AudioEffectEQ10 GD|AudioEffectEQ10]] or [[AudioEffectEQ21 GD|AudioEffectEQ21]] don't fit your needs.== Description ==AudioEffectEQ gives you control over frequencies. Use it to compensate for existing deficiencies in audio. AudioEffectEQs are useful on the Master bus to completely master a mix and give it more character. They are also useful when a game is run on a mobile device, to adjust the mix to that kind of speakers (it can be added but disabled when headphones are plugged).== Methods =={| class="wikitable | int|| [[#get_band_count|get_band_count]] '''(''' ''')''' const                                                                   |-| float|| [[#get_band_gain_db|get_band_gain_db]] '''(''' int band_idx ''')''' const                                |-| void|| [[#set_band_gain_db|set_band_gain_db]] '''(''' int band_idx, float volume_db ''')''' |}== Method Descriptions ===== get_band_count ===*  int '''get_band_count ( )''' constReturns the number of bands of the equalizer.=== get_band_gain_db ===*  float '''get_band_gain_db''' '''(''' int band_idx ''')''' constReturns the band's gain at the specified index, in dB.=== set_band_gain_db ===*  void '''set_band_gain_db''' '''(''' int band_idx, float volume_db ''')'''Sets band's gain at the specified index, in dB.
