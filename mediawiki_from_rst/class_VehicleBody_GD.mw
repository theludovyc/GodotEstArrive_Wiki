__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[RigidBody GD|RigidBody]] '''<''' [[PhysicsBody GD|PhysicsBody]] '''<''' [[CollisionObject GD|CollisionObject]] '''<''' [[Spatial GD|Spatial]] '''<''' [[Node GD|Node]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]Physics body that simulates the behavior of a car.== Description ==This node implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. You will need to add a [[CollisionShape GD|CollisionShape]] for the main body of your vehicle and add [[VehicleWheel GD|VehicleWheel]] nodes for the wheels. You should also add a [[MeshInstance GD|MeshInstance]] to this node for the 3D model of your car but this model should not include meshes for the wheels. You should control the vehicle by using the [[#brake|brake]], [[#engine_force|engine_force]], and [[#steering|steering]] properties and not change the position or orientation of this node directly.'''Note:''' The origin point of your VehicleBody will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle so it is better to keep this low and move the [[CollisionShape GD|CollisionShape]] and [[MeshInstance GD|MeshInstance]] upwards.== Properties =={| class="wikitable | float|| [[#brake|brake]]|| {{Span|0.0}}          |-| float|| [[#engine_force|engine_force]]|| {{Span|0.0}}          |-| float|| mass|| {{Span|40.0}} (parent override)  |-| float|| [[#steering|steering]]|| {{Span|0.0}}          |-| float|| weight|| {{Span|392.0}} (parent override) |}== Property Descriptions ===== brake ===*  float '''brake'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|0.0}}          |-| ''Setter''|| set_brake(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_brake()      |}Slows down the vehicle by applying a braking force. The vehicle is only slowed down if the wheels are in contact with a surface. The force you need to apply to adequately slow down your vehicle depends on the [[RigidBody GD#mass|RigidBody.mass()]] of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 30 range for hard braking.=== engine_force ===*  float '''engine_force'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|0.0}}                 |-| ''Setter''|| set_engine_force(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_engine_force()      |}Accelerates the vehicle by applying an engine force. The vehicle is only speed up if the wheels that have [[VehicleWheel GD#use_as_traction|VehicleWheel.use_as_traction()]] set to {{Span|true}} and are in contact with a surface. The [[RigidBody GD#mass|RigidBody.mass()]] of the vehicle has an effect on the acceleration of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 50 range for acceleration.'''Note:''' The simulation does not take the effect of gears into account, you will need to add logic for this if you wish to simulate gears.A negative value will result in the vehicle reversing.=== steering ===*  float '''steering'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|0.0}}             |-| ''Setter''|| set_steering(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_steering()      |}The steering angle for the vehicle. Setting this to a non-zero value will result in the vehicle turning when it's moving. Wheels that have [[VehicleWheel GD#use_as_steering|VehicleWheel.use_as_steering()]] set to {{Span|true}} will automatically be rotated.
