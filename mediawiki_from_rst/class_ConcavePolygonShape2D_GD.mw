It is made out of segments and is optimal for complex polygonal concave collisions. However, it is not advised to use for [[RigidBody2D GD|RigidBody2D]] nodes. A CollisionPolygon2D in convex decomposition mode (solids) or several convex objects are advised for that instead. Otherwise, a concave polygon 2D shape is better for static collisions.The main difference between a [[ConvexPolygonShape2D GD|ConvexPolygonShape2D]] and a {{Span|ConcavePolygonShape2D}} is that a concave polygon assumes it is concave and uses a more complex method of collision detection, and a convex one forces itself to be convex in order to speed up collision detection.== Properties =={| class="wikitable | [[PackedVector2Array GD|PackedVector2Array]]|| [[#segments|segments]]|| {{Span|PackedVector2Array(  )}} |}== Property Descriptions ===== segments ===*  [[PackedVector2Array GD|PackedVector2Array]] '''segments'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|PackedVector2Array(  )}} |-| ''Setter''|| set_segments(value)        |-| ''Getter''|| get_segments()             |}The array of points that make up the {{Span|ConcavePolygonShape2D}}'s line segments.
