The child node must inherit from [[CanvasItem GD|CanvasItem]] for it to be sorted. Nodes that have a higher Y position will be drawn later, so they will appear on top of nodes that have a lower Y position.Nesting of YSort nodes is possible. Children YSort nodes will be sorted in the same space as the parent YSort, allowing to better organize a scene or divide it in multiple ones, yet keep the unique sorting.== Properties =={| class="wikitable | bool|| [[#sort_enabled|sort_enabled]]|| {{Span|true}} |}== Property Descriptions ===== sort_enabled ===*  bool '''sort_enabled'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|true}}                |-| ''Setter''|| set_sort_enabled(value) |-| ''Getter''|| is_sort_enabled()       |}If {{Span|true}}, child nodes are sorted, otherwise sorting is disabled.
