The LightOccluder2D must be provided with an [[OccluderPolygon2D GD|OccluderPolygon2D]] in order for the shadow to be computed.== Tutorials ==*  :doc:`../tutorials/2d/2d_lights_and_shadows`== Properties =={| class="wikitable | int|| [[#light_mask|light_mask]]|| {{Span|1}} |-| [[OccluderPolygon2D GD|OccluderPolygon2D]]|| [[#occluder|occluder]]||       |}== Property Descriptions ===== light_mask ===*  int '''light_mask'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|1}}                          |-| ''Setter''|| set_occluder_light_mask(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_occluder_light_mask()      |}The LightOccluder2D's light mask.
