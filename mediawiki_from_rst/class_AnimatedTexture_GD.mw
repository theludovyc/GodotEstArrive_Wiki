__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]] '''<''' [[Texture GD|Texture]] '''<''' [[Resource GD|Resource]] '''<''' [[Reference GD|Reference]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]Proxy texture for simple frame-based animations.== Description =={{Span|AnimatedTexture}} is a resource format for frame-based animations, where multiple textures can be chained automatically with a predefined delay for each frame. Unlike [[AnimationPlayer GD|AnimationPlayer]] or [[AnimatedSprite GD|AnimatedSprite]], it isn't a [[Node GD|Node]], but has the advantage of being usable anywhere a [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]] resource can be used, e.g. in a [[TileSet GD|TileSet]].The playback of the animation is controlled by the [[#fps|fps]] property as well as each frame's optional delay (see [[#set_frame_delay|set_frame_delay]]). The animation loops, i.e. it will restart at frame 0 automatically after playing the last frame.{{Span|AnimatedTexture}} currently requires all frame textures to have the same size, otherwise the bigger ones will be cropped to match the smallest one. Also, it doesn't support [[AtlasTexture GD|AtlasTexture]]. Each frame needs to be separate image.== Properties =={| class="wikitable | float|| [[#fps|fps]]|| {{Span|4.0}} |-| int|| [[#frames|frames]]|| {{Span|1}}   |}== Methods =={| class="wikitable | float|| [[#get_frame_delay|get_frame_delay]] '''(''' int frame ''')''' const                                          |-| [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]]|| [[#get_frame_texture|get_frame_texture]] '''(''' int frame ''')''' const                                      |-| void|| [[#set_frame_delay|set_frame_delay]] '''(''' int frame, float delay ''')'''               |-| void|| [[#set_frame_texture|set_frame_texture]] '''(''' int frame, [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]] texture ''')''' |}== Constants ===== MAX_FRAMES ===*  '''MAX_FRAMES''' = '''256'''  The maximum number of frames supported by {{Span|AnimatedTexture}}. If you need more frames in your animation, use [[AnimationPlayer GD|AnimationPlayer]] or [[AnimatedSprite GD|AnimatedSprite]].== Property Descriptions ===== fps ===*  float '''fps'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|4.0}}        |-| ''Setter''|| set_fps(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_fps()      |}Animation speed in frames per second. This value defines the default time interval between two frames of the animation, and thus the overall duration of the animation loop based on the [[#frames|frames]] property. A value of 0 means no predefined number of frames per second, the animation will play according to each frame's frame delay (see [[#set_frame_delay|set_frame_delay]]).For example, an animation with 8 frames, no frame delay and a {{Span|fps}} value of 2 will run for 4 seconds, with each frame lasting 0.5 seconds.=== frames ===*  int '''frames'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|1}}             |-| ''Setter''|| set_frames(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_frames()      |}Number of frames to use in the animation. While you can create the frames independently with [[#set_frame_texture|set_frame_texture]], you need to set this value for the animation to take new frames into account. The maximum number of frames is [[AnimatedTexture GD#MAX_FRAMES|MAX_FRAMES]].== Method Descriptions ===== get_frame_delay ===*  float '''get_frame_delay''' '''(''' int frame ''')''' constReturns the given frame's delay value.=== get_frame_texture ===*  [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]] '''get_frame_texture''' '''(''' int frame ''')''' constReturns the given frame's [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]].=== set_frame_delay ===*  void '''set_frame_delay''' '''(''' int frame, float delay ''')'''Sets an additional delay (in seconds) between this frame and the next one, that will be added to the time interval defined by [[#fps|fps]]. By default, frames have no delay defined. If a delay value is defined, the final time interval between this frame and the next will be {{Span|1.0 / fps + delay}}.For example, for an animation with 3 frames, 2 FPS and a frame delay on the second frame of 1.2, the resulting playback will be:::    Frame 0: 0.5 s (1 / fps)    Frame 1: 1.7 s (1 / fps + 1.2)    Frame 2: 0.5 s (1 / fps)    Total duration: 2.7 s=== set_frame_texture ===*  void '''set_frame_texture''' '''(''' int frame, [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]] texture ''')'''Assigns a [[Texture2D GD|Texture2D]] to the given frame. Frame IDs start at 0, so the first frame has ID 0, and the last frame of the animation has ID [[#frames|frames]] - 1.You can define any number of textures up to [[AnimatedTexture GD#MAX_FRAMES|MAX_FRAMES]], but keep in mind that only frames from 0 to [[#frames|frames]] - 1 will be part of the animation.
