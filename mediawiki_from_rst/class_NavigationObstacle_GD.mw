__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Node GD|Node]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]3D Obstacle used in navigation for collision avoidance.== Description ==3D Obstacle used in navigation for collision avoidance. The obstacle needs navigation data to work correctly. This can be done by having the obstacle as a child of a [[Navigation GD|Navigation]] node, or using [[#set_navigation|set_navigation]]. {{Span|NavigationObstacle}} is physics safe.== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[Node GD|Node]]|| [[#get_navigation|get_navigation]] '''(''' ''')''' const                              |-| void|| [[#set_navigation|set_navigation]] '''(''' [[Node GD|Node]] navigation ''')''' |}== Method Descriptions ===== get_navigation ===*  [[Node GD|Node]] '''get_navigation ( )''' constReturns the [[Navigation GD|Navigation]] node that the obstacle is using for its navigation system.=== set_navigation ===*  void '''set_navigation''' '''(''' [[Node GD|Node]] navigation ''')'''Sets the [[Navigation GD|Navigation]] node used by the obstacle. Useful when you don't want to make the obstacle a child of a [[Navigation GD|Navigation]] node.
