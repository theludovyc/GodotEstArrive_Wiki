The obstacle needs navigation data to work correctly. This can be done by having the obstacle as a child of a [[Navigation2D GD|Navigation2D]] node, or using [[#set_navigation|set_navigation]]. [[NavigationObstacle GD|NavigationObstacle]] is physics safe.== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[Node GD|Node]]|| [[#get_navigation|get_navigation]] '''(''' ''')''' const                              |-| void|| [[#set_navigation|set_navigation]] '''(''' [[Node GD|Node]] navigation ''')''' |}== Method Descriptions ===== get_navigation ===*  [[Node GD|Node]] '''get_navigation ( )''' constReturns the [[Navigation2D GD|Navigation2D]] node that the obstacle is using for its navigation system.=== set_navigation ===*  void '''set_navigation''' '''(''' [[Node GD|Node]] navigation ''')'''Sets the [[Navigation2D GD|Navigation2D]] node used by the obstacle. Useful when you don't want to make the obstacle a child of a [[Navigation2D GD|Navigation2D]] node.
