__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Spatial GD|Spatial]] '''<''' [[Node GD|Node]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]A helper node, mostly used in 3rd person cameras.== Description ==The SpringArm node is a node that casts a ray (or collision shape) along its z axis and moves all its direct children to the collision point, minus a margin.The most common use case for this is to make a 3rd person camera that reacts to collisions in the environment.The SpringArm will either cast a ray, or if a shape is given, it will cast the shape in the direction of its z axis.If you use the SpringArm as a camera controller for your player, you might need to exclude the player's collider from the SpringArm's collision check.== Properties =={| class="wikitable | int|| [[#collision_mask|collision_mask]]|| {{Span|1}}    |-| float|| [[#margin|margin]]|| {{Span|0.01}} |-| [[Shape GD|Shape]]|| [[#shape|shape]]||          |-| float|| [[#spring_length|spring_length]]|| {{Span|1.0}}  |}== Methods =={| class="wikitable | void|| [[#add_excluded_object|add_excluded_object]] '''(''' [[RID GD|RID]] RID ''')'''       |-| void|| [[#clear_excluded_objects|clear_excluded_objects]] '''(''' ''')'''                           |-| float|| [[#get_hit_length|get_hit_length]] '''(''' ''')'''                                           |-| bool|| [[#remove_excluded_object|remove_excluded_object]] '''(''' [[RID GD|RID]] RID ''')''' |}== Property Descriptions ===== collision_mask ===*  int '''collision_mask'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|1}}                     |-| ''Setter''|| set_collision_mask(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_collision_mask()      |}The layers against which the collision check shall be done.=== margin ===*  float '''margin'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|0.01}}          |-| ''Setter''|| set_margin(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_margin()      |}When the collision check is made, a candidate length for the SpringArm is given.The margin is then subtracted to this length and the translation is applied to the child objects of the SpringArm.This margin is useful for when the SpringArm has a [[Camera GD|Camera]] as a child node: without the margin, the [[Camera GD|Camera]] would be placed on the exact point of collision, while with the margin the [[Camera GD|Camera]] would be placed close to the point of collision.=== shape ===*  [[Shape GD|Shape]] '''shape'''{| class="wikitable | ''Setter''|| set_shape(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_shape()      |}The [[Shape GD|Shape]] to use for the SpringArm.When the shape is set, the SpringArm will cast the [[Shape GD|Shape]] on its z axis instead of performing a ray cast.=== spring_length ===*  float '''spring_length'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|1.0}}           |-| ''Setter''|| set_length(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_length()      |}The maximum extent of the SpringArm. This is used as a length for both the ray and the shape cast used internally to calculate the desired position of the SpringArm's child nodes.To know more about how to perform a shape cast or a ray cast, please consult the [[PhysicsDirectSpaceState GD|PhysicsDirectSpaceState]] documentation.== Method Descriptions ===== add_excluded_object ===*  void '''add_excluded_object''' '''(''' [[RID GD|RID]] RID ''')'''Adds the [[PhysicsBody GD|PhysicsBody]] object with the given [[RID GD|RID]] to the list of [[PhysicsBody GD|PhysicsBody]] objects excluded from the collision check.=== clear_excluded_objects ===*  void '''clear_excluded_objects ( )'''Clears the list of [[PhysicsBody GD|PhysicsBody]] objects excluded from the collision check.=== get_hit_length ===*  float '''get_hit_length ( )'''Returns the proportion between the current arm length (after checking for collisions) and the [[#spring_length|spring_length]]. Ranges from 0 to 1.=== remove_excluded_object ===*  bool '''remove_excluded_object''' '''(''' [[RID GD|RID]] RID ''')'''Removes the given [[RID GD|RID]] from the list of [[PhysicsBody GD|PhysicsBody]] objects excluded from the collision check.
