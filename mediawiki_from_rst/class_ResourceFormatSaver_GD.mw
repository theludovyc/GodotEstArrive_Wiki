__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Reference GD|Reference]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]'''Inherited By:''' [[ResourceFormatSaverCrypto GD|ResourceFormatSaverCrypto]]Saves a specific resource type to a file.== Description ==The engine can save resources when you do it from the editor, or when you use the [[ResourceSaver GD|ResourceSaver]] singleton. This is accomplished thanks to multiple {{Span|ResourceFormatSaver}}\ s, each handling its own format and called automatically by the engine.By default, Godot saves resources as {{Span|.tres}} (text-based), {{Span|.res}} (binary) or another built-in format, but you can choose to create your own format by extending this class. Be sure to respect the documented return types and values. You should give it a global class name with {{Span|class_name}} for it to be registered. Like built-in ResourceFormatSavers, it will be called automatically when saving resources of its recognized type(s). You may also implement a [[ResourceFormatLoader GD|ResourceFormatLoader]].== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[PackedStringArray GD|PackedStringArray]]|| [[#get_recognized_extensions|get_recognized_extensions]] '''(''' [[Resource GD|Resource]] resource ''')''' virtual                      |-| bool|| [[#recognize|recognize]] '''(''' [[Resource GD|Resource]] resource ''')''' virtual                                                      |-| int|| [[#save|save]] '''(''' [[String GD|String]] path, [[Resource GD|Resource]] resource, int flags ''')''' virtual |}== Method Descriptions ===== get_recognized_extensions ===*  [[PackedStringArray GD|PackedStringArray]] '''get_recognized_extensions''' '''(''' [[Resource GD|Resource]] resource ''')''' virtualReturns the list of extensions available for saving the resource object, provided it is recognized (see [[#recognize|recognize]]).=== recognize ===*  bool '''recognize''' '''(''' [[Resource GD|Resource]] resource ''')''' virtualReturns whether the given resource object can be saved by this saver.=== save ===*  int '''save''' '''(''' [[String GD|String]] path, [[Resource GD|Resource]] resource, int flags ''')''' virtualSaves the given resource object to a file at the target {{Span|path}}. {{Span|flags}} is a bitmask composed with [[#SaverFlags|SaverFlags]] constants.Returns [[@GlobalScope GD#OK|@GlobalScope.OK()]] on success, or an [[@GlobalScope GD#Error|Error]] constant in case of failure.
