__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Reference GD|Reference]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]A unit of execution in a process.== Description ==A unit of execution in a process. Can run methods on [[Object GD|Object]]\ s simultaneously. The use of synchronization via [[Mutex GD|Mutex]] or [[Semaphore GD|Semaphore]] is advised if working with shared objects.== Tutorials ==*  :doc:`../tutorials/threads/using_multiple_threads`== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[String GD|String]]|| [[#get_id|get_id]] '''(''' ''')''' const                                                                                                                                                                         |-| bool|| [[#is_active|is_active]] '''(''' ''')''' const                                                                                                                                                                   |-| [[@GlobalScope GD#Error|Error]]|| [[#start|start]] '''(''' [[Object GD|Object]] instance, [[StringName GD|StringName]] method, [[Variant GD|Variant]] userdata=null, [[#Priority|Priority]] priority=1 ''')''' |-| [[Variant GD|Variant]]|| [[#wait_to_finish|wait_to_finish]] '''(''' ''')'''                                                                                                                                                               |}== Enumerations ===== Priority ====== PRIORITY_LOW ====== PRIORITY_NORMAL ====== PRIORITY_HIGH ===enum '''Priority''':*  '''PRIORITY_LOW''' = '''0'''  A thread running with lower priority than normally.*  '''PRIORITY_NORMAL''' = '''1'''  A thread with a standard priority.*  '''PRIORITY_HIGH''' = '''2'''  A thread running with higher priority than normally.== Method Descriptions ===== get_id ===*  [[String GD|String]] '''get_id ( )''' constReturns the current {{Span|Thread}}'s ID, uniquely identifying it among all threads.=== is_active ===*  bool '''is_active ( )''' constReturns {{Span|true}} if this {{Span|Thread}} is currently active. An active {{Span|Thread}} cannot start work on a new method but can be joined with [[#wait_to_finish|wait_to_finish]].=== start ===*  [[@GlobalScope GD#Error|Error]] '''start''' '''(''' [[Object GD|Object]] instance, [[StringName GD|StringName]] method, [[Variant GD|Variant]] userdata=null, [[#Priority|Priority]] priority=1 ''')'''Starts a new {{Span|Thread}} that runs {{Span|method}} on object {{Span|instance}} with {{Span|userdata}} passed as an argument. The {{Span|priority}} of the {{Span|Thread}} can be changed by passing a value from the [[#Priority|Priority]] enum.Returns [[@GlobalScope GD#OK|@GlobalScope.OK()]] on success, or [[@GlobalScope GD#ERR_CANT_CREATE|@GlobalScope.ERR_CANT_CREATE()]] on failure.=== wait_to_finish ===*  [[Variant GD|Variant]] '''wait_to_finish ( )'''Joins the {{Span|Thread}} and waits for it to finish. Returns what the method called returned.
