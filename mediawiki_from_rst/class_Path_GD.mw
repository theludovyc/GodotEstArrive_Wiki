__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Spatial GD|Spatial]] '''<''' [[Node GD|Node]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]Contains a [[Curve3D GD|Curve3D]] path for [[PathFollow GD|PathFollow]] nodes to follow.== Description ==Can have [[PathFollow GD|PathFollow]] child nodes moving along the [[Curve3D GD|Curve3D]]. See [[PathFollow GD|PathFollow]] for more information on the usage.Note that the path is considered as relative to the moved nodes (children of [[PathFollow GD|PathFollow]]). As such, the curve should usually start with a zero vector {{Span|(0, 0, 0)}}.== Properties =={| class="wikitable | [[Curve3D GD|Curve3D]]|| [[#curve|curve]] |}== Signals ===== curve_changed ===*  '''curve_changed ( )'''Emitted when the [[#curve|curve]] changes.== Property Descriptions ===== curve ===*  [[Curve3D GD|Curve3D]] '''curve'''{| class="wikitable | ''Setter''|| set_curve(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_curve()      |}A [[Curve3D GD|Curve3D]] describing the path.
