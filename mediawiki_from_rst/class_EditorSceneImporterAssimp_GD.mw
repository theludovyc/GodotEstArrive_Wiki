It currently has many known limitations and works best with static meshes. Most animated meshes won't import correctly.If exporting a FBX scene from Autodesk Maya, use these FBX export settings:::    - Smoothing Groups    - Smooth Mesh    - Triangluate (for meshes with blend shapes)    - Bake Animation    - Resample All    - Deformed Models    - Skins    - Blend Shapes    - Curve Filters    - Constant Key Reducer    - Auto Tangents Only    - *Do not check* Constraints (as it will break the file)    - Can check Embed Media (embeds textures into the exported FBX file)      - Note that when importing embedded media, the texture and mesh will be a single immutable file.      - You will have to re-export then re-import the FBX if the texture has changed.    - Units: Centimeters    - Up Axis: Y    - Binary format in FBX 2017
