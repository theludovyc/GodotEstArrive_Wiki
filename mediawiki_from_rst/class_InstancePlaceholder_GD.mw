__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Node GD|Node]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]Placeholder for the root [[Node GD|Node]] of a [[PackedScene GD|PackedScene]].== Description ==Turning on the option '''Load As Placeholder''' for an instanced scene in the editor causes it to be replaced by an {{Span|InstancePlaceholder}} when running the game. This makes it possible to delay actually loading the scene until calling [[#create_instance|create_instance]]. This is useful to avoid loading large scenes all at once by loading parts of it selectively.The {{Span|InstancePlaceholder}} does not have a transform. This causes any child nodes to be positioned relatively to the [[Viewport GD|Viewport]] from point (0,0), rather than their parent as displayed in the editor. Replacing the placeholder with a scene with a transform will transform children relatively to their parent again.== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[Node GD|Node]]|| [[#create_instance|create_instance]] '''(''' bool replace=false, [[PackedScene GD|PackedScene]] custom_scene=null ''')''' |-| [[String GD|String]]|| [[#get_instance_path|get_instance_path]] '''(''' ''')''' const                                                                                      |-| [[Dictionary GD|Dictionary]]|| [[#get_stored_values|get_stored_values]] '''(''' bool with_order=false ''')'''                                                   |}== Method Descriptions ===== create_instance ===*  [[Node GD|Node]] '''create_instance''' '''(''' bool replace=false, [[PackedScene GD|PackedScene]] custom_scene=null ''')'''=== get_instance_path ===*  [[String GD|String]] '''get_instance_path ( )''' constGets the path to the [[PackedScene GD|PackedScene]] resource file that is loaded by default when calling [[#create_instance|create_instance]].=== get_stored_values ===*  [[Dictionary GD|Dictionary]] '''get_stored_values''' '''(''' bool with_order=false ''')'''
