__NOTOC__An optimized string type for unique names.== Description =={{Span|StringName}}\ s are immutable strings designed for general-purpose represention of unique names. {{Span|StringName}} ensures that only one instance of a given name exists (so two {{Span|StringName}}\ s with the same value are the same object). Comparing them is much faster than with regular [[String GD|String]]\ s, because only the pointers are compared, not the whole strings.== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[StringName GD|StringName]]|| [[StringName GD#StringName|StringName]] '''(''' [[String GD|String]] from ''')''' |}== Method Descriptions ===== StringName ===*  [[StringName GD|StringName]] '''StringName''' '''(''' [[String GD|String]] from ''')'''Creates a new {{Span|StringName}} from the given [[String GD|String]].
