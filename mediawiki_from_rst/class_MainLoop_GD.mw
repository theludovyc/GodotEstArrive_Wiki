__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Object GD|Object]]'''Inherited By:''' [[SceneTree GD|SceneTree]]Abstract base class for the game's main loop.== Description =={{Span|MainLoop}} is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by [[SceneTree GD|SceneTree]], which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also possible to write and use one's own {{Span|MainLoop}} subclass instead of the scene tree.Upon the application start, a {{Span|MainLoop}} implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise, the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [[SceneTree GD|SceneTree]] is created) unless a main [[Script GD|Script]] is provided from the command line (with e.g. {{Span|godot -s my_loop.gd}}, which should then be a {{Span|MainLoop}} implementation.Here is an example script implementing a simple {{Span|MainLoop}}:::    extends MainLoop        var time_elapsed = 0    var keys_typed = []    var quit = false        func _initialize():        print("Initialized:")        print("  Starting time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))        func _idle(delta):        time_elapsed += delta        # Return true to end the main loop.        return quit        func _input_event(event):        # Record keys.        if event is InputEventKey and event.pressed and !event.echo:            keys_typed.append(OS.get_keycode_string(event.keycode))            # Quit on Escape press.            if event.keycode == KEY_ESCAPE:                quit = true        # Quit on any mouse click.        if event is InputEventMouseButton:            quit = true        func _finalize():        print("Finalized:")        print("  End time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))        print("  Keys typed: %s" % var2str(keys_typed))== Methods =={| class="wikitable | void|| [[MainLoop GD#_drop_files|_drop_files]] '''(''' [[PackedStringArray GD|PackedStringArray]] files, int from_screen ''')''' virtual |-| void|| [[MainLoop GD#_finalize|_finalize]] '''(''' ''')''' virtual                                                                                                |-| void|| [[MainLoop GD#_global_menu_action|_global_menu_action]] '''(''' [[Variant GD|Variant]] id, [[Variant GD|Variant]] meta ''')''' virtual       |-| bool|| [[MainLoop GD#_idle|_idle]] '''(''' float delta ''')''' virtual                                                                        |-| void|| [[MainLoop GD#_initialize|_initialize]] '''(''' ''')''' virtual                                                                                            |-| void|| [[MainLoop GD#_input_event|_input_event]] '''(''' [[InputEvent GD|InputEvent]] event ''')''' virtual                                                |-| void|| [[MainLoop GD#_input_text|_input_text]] '''(''' [[String GD|String]] text ''')''' virtual                                                           |-| bool|| [[MainLoop GD#_iteration|_iteration]] '''(''' float delta ''')''' virtual                                                              |-| void|| [[#finish|finish]] '''(''' ''')'''                                                                                                              |-| bool|| [[#idle|idle]] '''(''' float delta ''')'''                                                                                  |-| void|| [[#init|init]] '''(''' ''')'''                                                                                                                  |-| void|| [[#input_event|input_event]] '''(''' [[InputEvent GD|InputEvent]] event ''')'''                                                          |-| void|| [[#input_text|input_text]] '''(''' [[String GD|String]] text ''')'''                                                                     |-| bool|| [[#iteration|iteration]] '''(''' float delta ''')'''                                                                        |}== Signals ===== on_request_permissions_result ===*  '''on_request_permissions_result''' '''(''' [[String GD|String]] permission, bool granted ''')'''Emitted when a user responds to a permission request.== Constants ===== NOTIFICATION_WM_MOUSE_ENTER ====== NOTIFICATION_WM_MOUSE_EXIT ====== NOTIFICATION_WM_FOCUS_IN ====== NOTIFICATION_WM_FOCUS_OUT ====== NOTIFICATION_WM_QUIT_REQUEST ====== NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST ====== NOTIFICATION_WM_UNFOCUS_REQUEST ====== NOTIFICATION_OS_MEMORY_WARNING ====== NOTIFICATION_TRANSLATION_CHANGED ====== NOTIFICATION_WM_ABOUT ====== NOTIFICATION_CRASH ====== NOTIFICATION_OS_IME_UPDATE ====== NOTIFICATION_APP_RESUMED ====== NOTIFICATION_APP_PAUSED ===*  '''NOTIFICATION_WM_MOUSE_ENTER''' = '''1002'''  Notification received from the OS when the mouse enters the game window.Implemented on desktop and web platforms.*  '''NOTIFICATION_WM_MOUSE_EXIT''' = '''1003'''  Notification received from the OS when the mouse leaves the game window.Implemented on desktop and web platforms.*  '''NOTIFICATION_WM_FOCUS_IN''' = '''1004'''  Notification received from the OS when the game window is focused.Implemented on all platforms.*  '''NOTIFICATION_WM_FOCUS_OUT''' = '''1005'''  Notification received from the OS when the game window is unfocused.Implemented on all platforms.*  '''NOTIFICATION_WM_QUIT_REQUEST''' = '''1006'''  Notification received from the OS when a quit request is sent (e.g. closing the window with a "Close" button or Alt+F4).Implemented on desktop platforms.*  '''NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST''' = '''1007'''  Notification received from the OS when a go back request is sent (e.g. pressing the "Back" button on Android).Specific to the Android platform.*  '''NOTIFICATION_WM_UNFOCUS_REQUEST''' = '''1008'''  Notification received from the OS when an unfocus request is sent (e.g. another OS window wants to take the focus).No supported platforms currently send this notification.*  '''NOTIFICATION_OS_MEMORY_WARNING''' = '''1009'''  Notification received from the OS when the application is exceeding its allocated memory.Specific to the iOS platform.*  '''NOTIFICATION_TRANSLATION_CHANGED''' = '''1010'''  Notification received when translations may have changed.

Equivalent to [[Node GD#_process|_process]].If implemented, the method must return a boolean value. {{Span|true}} ends the main loop, while {{Span|false}} lets it proceed to the next frame.=== _initialize ===*  void '''_initialize ( )''' virtualCalled once during initialization.=== _input_event ===*  void '''_input_event''' '''(''' [[InputEvent GD|InputEvent]] event ''')''' virtualCalled whenever an [[InputEvent GD|InputEvent]] is received by the main loop.=== _input_text ===*  void '''_input_text''' '''(''' [[String GD|String]] text ''')''' virtualDeprecated callback, does not do anything. Use [[MainLoop GD#_input_event|_input_event]] to parse text input.
