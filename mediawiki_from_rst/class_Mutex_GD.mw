This is used to synchronize multiple [[Thread GD|Thread]]\ s, and is equivalent to a binary [[Semaphore GD|Semaphore]]. It guarantees that only one thread can ever acquire the lock at a time. A mutex can be used to protect a critical section; however, be careful to avoid deadlocks.== Tutorials ==*  :doc:`../tutorials/threads/using_multiple_threads`== Methods =={| class="wikitable | void|| [[#lock|lock]] '''(''' ''')'''         |-| [[@GlobalScope GD#Error|Error]]|| [[#try_lock|try_lock]] '''(''' ''')''' |-| void|| [[#unlock|unlock]] '''(''' ''')'''     |}== Method Descriptions ===== lock ===*  void '''lock ( )'''Locks this {{Span|Mutex}}, blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.=== try_lock ===*  [[@GlobalScope GD#Error|Error]] '''try_lock ( )'''Tries locking this {{Span|Mutex}}, but does not block. Returns [[@GlobalScope GD#OK|@GlobalScope.OK()]] on success, [[@GlobalScope GD#ERR_BUSY|@GlobalScope.ERR_BUSY()]] otherwise.=== unlock ===*  void '''unlock ( )'''Unlocks this {{Span|Mutex}}, leaving it to other threads.
