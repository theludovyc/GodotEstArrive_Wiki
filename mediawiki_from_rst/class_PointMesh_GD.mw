Instead of relying on triangles, points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to be used with Particle systems, but can be used as a cheap way to render constant size billboarded sprites (for example in a point cloud).PointMeshes, must be used with a material that has a point size. Point size can be accessed in a shader with {{Span|POINT_SIZE}}, or in a [[BaseMaterial3D GD|BaseMaterial3D]] by setting [[BaseMaterial3D GD#use_point_size|BaseMaterial3D.use_point_size()]] and the variable [[BaseMaterial3D GD#point_size|BaseMaterial3D.point_size()]].When using PointMeshes, properties that normally alter vertices will be ignored, including billboard mode, grow, and cull face.
