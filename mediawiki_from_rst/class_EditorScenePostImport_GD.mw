Usage example:::    tool # Needed so it runs in editor    extends EditorScenePostImport        # This sample changes all node names        # Called right after the scene is imported and gets the root node    func post_import(scene):        # Change all node names to "modified_[oldnodename]"        iterate(scene)        return scene # Remember to return the imported scene        func iterate(node):        if node != null:            node.name = "modified_" + node.name            for child in node.get_children():                iterate(child)== Tutorials ==*  `#custom-script <../getting_started/workflow/assets/importing_scenes.html#custom-script>`_ in :doc:`../getting_started/workflow/assets/importing_scenes`== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[String GD|String]]|| [[#get_source_file|get_source_file]] '''(''' ''')''' const                             |-| [[String GD|String]]|| [[#get_source_folder|get_source_folder]] '''(''' ''')''' const                         |-| [[Object GD|Object]]|| [[#post_import|post_import]] '''(''' [[Object GD|Object]] scene ''')''' virtual |}== Method Descriptions ===== get_source_file ===*  [[String GD|String]] '''get_source_file ( )''' constReturns the source file path which got imported (e.g. {{Span|res://scene.dae}}).=== get_source_folder ===*  [[String GD|String]] '''get_source_folder ( )''' constReturns the resource folder the imported scene file is located in.=== post_import ===*  [[Object GD|Object]] '''post_import''' '''(''' [[Object GD|Object]] scene ''')''' virtualCalled after the scene was imported.
