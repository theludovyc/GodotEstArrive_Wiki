__NOTOC__'''Inherits:''' [[Node2D GD|Node2D]] '''<''' [[CanvasItem GD|CanvasItem]] '''<''' [[Node GD|Node]] '''<''' [[Object GD|Object]]Skeleton for 2D characters and animated objects.== Description ==Skeleton2D parents a hierarchy of [[Bone2D GD|Bone2D]] objects. It is a requirement of [[Bone2D GD|Bone2D]]. Skeleton2D holds a reference to the rest pose of its children and acts as a single point of access to its bones.== Tutorials ==*  :doc:`../tutorials/animation/2d_skeletons`== Methods =={| class="wikitable | [[Bone2D GD|Bone2D]]|| [[#get_bone|get_bone]] '''(''' int idx ''')''' |-| int|| [[#get_bone_count|get_bone_count]] '''(''' ''')''' const         |-| [[RID GD|RID]]|| [[#get_skeleton|get_skeleton]] '''(''' ''')''' const             |}== Signals ===== bone_setup_changed ===*  '''bone_setup_changed ( )'''== Method Descriptions ===== get_bone ===*  [[Bone2D GD|Bone2D]] '''get_bone''' '''(''' int idx ''')'''Returns a [[Bone2D GD|Bone2D]] from the node hierarchy parented by Skeleton2D. The object to return is identified by the parameter {{Span|idx}}. Bones are indexed by descending the node hierarchy from top to bottom, adding the children of each branch before moving to the next sibling.=== get_bone_count ===*  int '''get_bone_count ( )''' constReturns the number of [[Bone2D GD|Bone2D]] nodes in the node hierarchy parented by Skeleton2D.=== get_skeleton ===*  [[RID GD|RID]] '''get_skeleton ( )''' constReturns the [[RID GD|RID]] of a Skeleton2D instance.
