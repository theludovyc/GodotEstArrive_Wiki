A static body is a simple body that is not intended to move. In contrast to [[RigidBody GD|RigidBody]], they don't consume any CPU resources as long as they don't move.Additionally, a constant linear or angular velocity can be set for the static body, so even if it doesn't move, it affects other bodies as if it was moving (this is useful for simulating conveyor belts or conveyor wheels).== Properties =={| class="wikitable | [[Vector3 GD|Vector3]]|| [[#constant_angular_velocity|constant_angular_velocity]]|| {{Span|Vector3( 0, 0, 0 )}} |-| [[Vector3 GD|Vector3]]|| [[#constant_linear_velocity|constant_linear_velocity]]|| {{Span|Vector3( 0, 0, 0 )}} |-| [[PhysicsMaterial GD|PhysicsMaterial]]|| [[#physics_material_override|physics_material_override]]||                        |}== Property Descriptions ===== constant_angular_velocity ===*  [[Vector3 GD|Vector3]] '''constant_angular_velocity'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|Vector3( 0, 0, 0 )}}               |-| ''Setter''|| set_constant_angular_velocity(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_constant_angular_velocity()      |}The body's constant angular velocity. This does not rotate the body, but affects other bodies that touch it, as if it was in a state of rotation.=== constant_linear_velocity ===*  [[Vector3 GD|Vector3]] '''constant_linear_velocity'''{| class="wikitable | ''Default''|| {{Span|Vector3( 0, 0, 0 )}}              |-| ''Setter''|| set_constant_linear_velocity(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_constant_linear_velocity()      |}The body's constant linear velocity. This does not move the body, but affects other bodies that touch it, as if it was in a state of movement.=== physics_material_override ===*  [[PhysicsMaterial GD|PhysicsMaterial]] '''physics_material_override'''{| class="wikitable | ''Setter''|| set_physics_material_override(value) |-| ''Getter''|| get_physics_material_override()      |}The physics material override for the body.If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.
