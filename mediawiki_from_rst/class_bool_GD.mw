__NOTOC__Boolean built-in type.== Description ==Boolean is a built-in type. It can represent any data type that is either a true or false value. You can think of it as an switch with on or off (1 or 0) setting. It's often used as part of programming logic in condition statements like {{Span|if}} statements.'''Note:''' In a code below {{Span|if can_shoot}} is equivalent of {{Span|if can_shoot == true}}. It is good practice to follow the natural spoken language structure when possible. Use {{Span|if can_shoot}} rather than {{Span|if can_shoot == true}} and use {{Span|if not can_shoot}} rather than {{Span|if can_shoot == false}}.::    var can_shoot = true        func shoot():        if can_shoot:            # Perform shooting actions here.The following code will only create a bullet if both conditions are met: action "shoot" is pressed and if {{Span|can_shoot}} is {{Span|true}}.'''Note:''' {{Span|Input.is_action_pressed("shoot")}} is also a boolean that is {{Span|true}} when "shoot" is pressed and {{Span|false}} when "shoot" isn't pressed.::    var can_shoot = true        func shoot():        if can_shoot and Input.is_action_pressed("shoot"):            create_bullet()The following code will set {{Span|can_shoot}} to {{Span|false}} and start a timer. This will prevent player from shooting until the timer runs out. Next {{Span|can_shoot}} will be set to {{Span|true}} again allowing player to shoot once again.::    var can_shoot = true    onready var cool_down = $CoolDownTimer        func shoot():        if can_shoot and Input.is_action_pressed("shoot"):            create_bullet()            can_shoot = false            cool_down.start()        func _on_CoolDownTimer_timeout():        can_shoot = true== Methods =={| class="wikitable | bool|| [[#bool|bool]] '''(''' int from ''')'''       |-| bool|| [[#bool|bool]] '''(''' float from ''')'''   |-| bool|| [[#bool|bool]] '''(''' [[String GD|String]] from ''')''' |}== Method Descriptions ===== bool ===*  bool '''bool''' '''(''' int from ''')'''Cast an int value to a boolean value, this method will return {{Span|true}} if called with an integer value different to 0 and {{Span|false}} in other case.*  bool '''bool''' '''(''' float from ''')'''Cast a float value to a boolean value, this method will return {{Span|true}} if called with a floating-point value different to 0 and {{Span|false}} in other case.*  bool '''bool''' '''(''' [[String GD|String]] from ''')'''Cast a [[String GD|String]] value to a boolean value, this method will return {{Span|true}} if called with a non-empty string and {{Span|false}} in other case. Examples: {{Span|bool("False")}} returns {{Span|true}}, {{Span|bool("")}} returns {{Span|false}}.
